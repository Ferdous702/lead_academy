							<p><strong>How your data is processed</strong></p>
							<p>
								<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
							</p>
							<p>Lead Academy’s main approach to processing your personal information and other data has a foundation of three lawful principles: Consent, Performance of a Contract, and Legitimate Interest.</p>
							<p>
								<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
							</p>
							<p><strong>Consent</strong></p>
							<p>
								<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
